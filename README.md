# 📊 Netflix TV Shows and Movies – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset, sourced from **Flixable** (a third-party Netflix search engine), captures content-related data including title, type, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, and genres.

According to Flixable's 2018 report, while the number of movies on Netflix has **decreased by over 2,000 titles** since 2010, the number of TV shows has **nearly tripled**. This signals a strategic pivot in Netflix’s content approach, likely influenced by changing audience preferences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze trends in Netflix’s content strategy (TV Shows vs. Movies)
- Explore what type of content is available across different countries
- Study genre distribution and release year patterns
- Handle missing values and clean dataset for analysis
- Cluster similar content using text-based features (e.g., title, cast, description)
- Lay the foundation for integrating external datasets like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **WordCloud**, **Scikit-learn** for text analysis and clustering
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation

## 📌 Key Insights

- Netflix has significantly increased its focus on **TV Shows** in the last decade.
- The **genre distribution** highlights user preferences shifting toward drama, documentaries, and reality content.
- Content **availability by country** reveals regional content priorities and licensing constraints.
- Initial clustering reveals interesting groupings based on **cast**, **description keywords**, and **content duration**.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate external data sources (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes) for deeper content quality analysis
- Perform sentiment analysis on descriptions or user reviews
- Create a recommendation engine using content similarity



## 📸 Visualizations

Included in the notebook are:
- Missing values heatmap
- Year-wise content trends
- Country-based content distribution
- Correlation heatmaps
- Genre and rating breakdowns
